    # Reviewgh-pages branch is usually used for deployment, 
    # but since this is a user site (username.github.io), 
    # GitHub expects the built content on the 'master' branch.
    # HOWEVER, Docusaurus recommends keeping source code in a separate branch (e.g., 'main' or 'source')
    # and deploying the build to 'gh-pages' (or 'master').
    
    # STRATEGY:
    # 1. We assume your source code is now on 'master' (or you will rename it to 'main').
    # 2. We will deploy the built site to the 'gh-pages' branch.
    # 3. You must change your GitHub Pages settings to serve from 'gh-pages'.
